## Controls

- Computer keyboard mapping:
  - `Z S X D C V G B H N J M , L . ; /`
  - `[` and `]` to shift the keyboard octave

## SoundFonts

The app uses SoundFont files for instrument sounds. The default soundfont is set in
`lib/common/constants.dart` (`rhodesSoundFontAsset`). But you can upload your own SoundFont files and use them in the app.
